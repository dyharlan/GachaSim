# Gacha Simulator Framework.
 A terrible Gacha Simulator Framework for a Terrible Game Genre.
 
 The example code simulates a genshin impact roll session.
 
 TODO:
- Implement Fate Points (Genshin, could be too complex to be worth.)
- Improve the UI Design.
- Make sure that the Gacha Pool isn't hardcoded anymore. Preferrably, it should be loaded from a file for larger gacha games.
